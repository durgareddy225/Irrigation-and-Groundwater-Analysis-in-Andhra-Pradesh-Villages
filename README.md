# Irrigation-and-Groundwater-Analysis-in-Andhra-Pradesh-Villages
This project helps in understanding irrigation trends and groundwater behavior in rural Andhra Pradesh. It supports data-driven insights for agriculture planning, water resource management, and policy-making. It can also serve academic, environmental, and government research needs. 

✨ Key Highlights of the Project

🧩 Completeness Check
Not just visualization – assess data integrity by exploring missing values in the Major & Medium scheme data.

📊 Irrigation at a Glance
Visualize district-wise irrigation stats, tribal village counts, and seasonal irrigation patterns.

📦 Irrigation Area Insights
Use box plots to spot irrigation outliers and study the variation between net and gross irrigated land.

🏆 Top-Performing Villages
Spotlight on the Top 10 most irrigated villages, season-wise – who’s leading the charge in efficient water use.

📈 Line Plots:
Compare groundwater levels pre and post monsoon across districts.

🌡️ Hotspot Detection
A heatmap that reveals hidden correlations between irrigation areas, cultivable land, and groundwater levels – a goldmine for analysts.

📤 Insights to Go
Export vital outputs like irrigation rankings or groundwater summaries to CSV – great for reports or further modeling.

🗂️ Data Source
Primary dataset: APVillageSchedule.csv – real village-level stats from Andhra Pradesh’s irrigation census (data.gov.in).
